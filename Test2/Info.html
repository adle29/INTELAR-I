   <p> Intelar is a prototype of an artificial intelligence still in development designed to impulse 
        self-learning. Intelar has different functions. You can chat with him, ask him about information,
        and use his integrated graphing calculator. To communicate with him just, type or press the microphone
        icon on the textfield.<p>
        
        <h2>MOOD</h2>
   <p> 
      To change Intelar's mood, color and tone of voice just tell him what you feel. 
        Example: I love you, I hate you,  I like you, I dislike you, etc.
   </p>
   <h2>SEARCH FUNCTION</h2>
   <p> 
      Intelar has an integrated search function. I you ask about a topic, Intelar will tell you a brief explanation 
      about it. You just have to say about "topic". If intelar doesn't find information about what you are requesting
      you should check if you misspelled a word, or try giving a different name.
       Examples: For the word "Sports", Intelar won't find anything, but for the word "Sport", Intelar will tell you what
       he knows. Also "Olympics" doesn't match Intelar's data base but "Olympic games" does.
